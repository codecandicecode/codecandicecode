## Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I'm Candice and I'm learning to programme in Python as fast as I type. Let's see how long this takes me...
- 🔭 I’m currently working on sharpening my programming skills as I have a cool idea that requires algorithm techniques
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that throws me in the deep end!
- 💬 Ask me about films, cool particles (like neutrinos!), food... or something else
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or Instagram maybe
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm self-studying A-Levels so could talk about topics in A Level Maths and Physics (and i guess FM...) all day
